# As the size of the interval decreases by half, the tick length decreases by one. 

# For each inch (co the coi nhu 1cm), we place a tick with a numeric label. 
# We denote the length of the tick designating a whole inch as the "major tick length". 
# Between the marks for whole inches, the ruler contains a series of "minor ticks", 
# place at intervals of 1/2 inch, 1/4 inch, and so on.
